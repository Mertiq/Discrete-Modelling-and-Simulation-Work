# Discrete-Modelling-and-Simulation-Work
The problem definition:
A machine tool in a manufacturing shop is turning out parts at the rate of every 5 minutes. 
As they are finished, the parts are sent to an inspector who takes 6Â±4 minutes (uniform distribution) to examine each one and rejects about 10% of the parts as faulty. 
You are asked to run the simulation for 100 faulty parts to leave the system. 
Gather the statistics about average and maximum queue lengths.
